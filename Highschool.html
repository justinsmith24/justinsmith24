<h1>High School </h1>
I graduated high school in 2016 from Bangor High School. There were 1,200 students in my high school and 273 in my
graduating class. I had a 3.6 gpa and was 50th in my class. My favorite subjects were business and math so I knew that
I wanted to go to college for one of those things.

<H3> Sports </H3>
In high school I played basketball for four years and football for two years
My senior year basketball season, I averaged 13 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists per game for the Bangor Rams.
We had a 6-12 season but it was the first season under a new head coach, Carl Parker. He was an outstanding coach 
and even a better person. He had a huge impact on my development on and off the court. I made the playoffs twice in my 
high school career but I never won a playoff game.

<p> My varsity football career was only my freshman and senior year because I focused on only basketball for a couple of years. 
During my senior season I scored four touchdowns and had more than 300 receiving yards as a tight end. My coach was Al Mosca 
who was also my freshman football coach. His first varsity season was my senior year which was a big reason in my decision to 
return to football.
