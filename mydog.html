	<p>Sammus </h2>
		
		<P> In 2011 my family adopted my dog from the Humaine Society in Bangor. His name 
		is Sammus and it was given to him from the shelter. We are unsure of his age but 
		it was estimated that he was 5 years old when we got him. This means that he turned
		12 this October. He loves to go for walks and has a powerful nose that makes him run
		away all the time. He is a walker beagle mix and he is the nicest dog you'll ever 
		meet.
